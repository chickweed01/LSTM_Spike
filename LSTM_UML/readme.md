# LSTM via UML
> An exploration of Long Short-term Memory Cells using a UML-based approach

## Introduction
In my quest to have a better understanding if how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells function I decided to model a cell using UML and implement it in C#. (I'll assume that you are familar with the use of LSTM cells in recurrent neural networks, so I won't get into a discusion here.) The question then became how to validate that my implementation was accurate. Fortunately, I came across an [article](https://bit.ly/2NMdn5n) in MSDN Magazine by James McCaffrey of Microsoft Research. In this article Dr. McCaffrey describes an implemention of a LSTM cell written in C#. With Dr McCaffrey's program in hand to be used as a benchmark I set out to create a model of an LSTM cell and its components expressed as UML classes.
